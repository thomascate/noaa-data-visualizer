Measurement Flag , Quality Flag , Quality Flag
Only one option, or blank per field


Example entry
TMAX_ATTRIBUTES: "H,,U"

turn this into

TMAX_ATTRIBUTES: {
  Measurement_Flag: "H",
  Quality_Flag: "",
  Source_Flag: "U"
}


Allows queries like
TMAX_ATTRIBUTES.Quality_Flag.keyword = ""
to find all good quality data.


Table 1 (Measurement Flag/Attribute)
Blank = no measurement information applicable
 A = value in precipitation or snow is a multi-day total, accumulated since last measurement
 (used on Daily Form pdf file)
 B = precipitation total formed from two twelve-hour totals
 D = precipitation total formed from four six-hour totals
 H = represents highest or lowest hourly temperature (TMAX or TMIN)
 or average of hourly values (TAVG)
 K = converted from knots
 L = temperature appears to be lagged with respect to reported
 hour of observation
 O = converted from oktas
 P = identified as "missing presumed zero" in DSI 3200 and 3206
 T = trace of precipitation, snowfall, or snow depth
 W = converted from 16-point WBAN code (for wind direction)
Table 2 (Quality Flag/Attribute)
Blank = did not fail any quality assurance check
 D = failed duplicate check
 G = failed gap check
 I = failed internal consistency check
 K = failed streak/frequent-value check
 L = failed check on length of multiday period
 M = failed mega-consistency check
 N = failed naught check
 O = failed climatological outlier check
 R = failed lagged range check
 S = failed spatial consistency check
 T = failed temporal consistency check
 W = temperature too warm for snow
 X = failed bounds check
 Z = flagged as a result of an official Datzilla investigation
Table 3 (Source Flag/Attribute)

 S = Global Summary of the Day (NCDC DSI-9618)
 NOTE: "S" values are derived from hourly synoptic reports
 exchanged on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).
 Daily values derived in this fashion may differ significantly
 from "true" daily data, particularly for precipitation(i.e., use with caution).
 s = China Meteorological Administration/National Meteorological Information Center/
 Climate Data Center (http://cdc.cma.gov.cn)
